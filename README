This is the README file for Multi (v 1.00), a simple module to handle
printing to multiple (output) filehandles.

Requires: FileHandle module.

Installation:  You should know the routine by now...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

If for some reason MakeMaker is broken or you have a personal problem with
the make command (seek help), you can just copy Multi.pm into your perl
site directory and everything should be okay.
